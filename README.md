# Gstrl


**Gstrl** adds gesture, voice, and AI agent control to macOS. **Pinch to move cursor. Swipe for arrows. Hold fists to talk to Claude. Circle to screenshot.** All on-device via Apple Vision + SFSpeechRecognizer.

For when you're lying back, vibe coding, presenting, or just tired of gripping a mouse or using trackpad all day.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TomYang-TZ/Gstrl.git
cd Gstrl
make install   # builds + installs to /Applications
```

```bash
make run       # build + launch
make restart   # stop + rebuild + launch
make stop      # kill it
```

App auto-opens permission pages on first launch (Camera, Accessibility, Screen Recording, Speech).

### AI Agent (both fists) — requires [Claude Code CLI](https://claude.ai/claude-code)

Hold both fists for 1 second to activate the AI agent. Speak your question — after 3 seconds of silence, it sends to Claude Code and reads the response aloud.

- Captures selected text as context (Cmd+C before sending)
- Multi-turn conversations within same session
- Dismiss the response overlay (X) to start a new session
- Full chat history in the app's Agent tab

### "Pro" tips

- **Keyboard + Gesture** — Hold a modifier key while gesturing. Shift + swipe = select text. Cmd + swipe = jump words.
- **Screenshot → AI** — Circle-capture a region, then hold both fists to ask Claude about what's on screen.
- **Select → AI** — Drag to highlight text (pinch + hold + move), then hold both fists. Claude sees your selection as context.

## Dynamic Island

A floating glass overlay at the top of your screen (macOS 26+ Liquid Glass):
- Expands downward to show live transcription, agent thinking/actions, or response text
- Inline controls: terminate agent, collapse response, dismiss

## Requirements

- macOS 14+ (Liquid Glass needs macOS 26+, falls back gracefully)
- Webcam
- Swift 5.9+

### Optional

- [Claude Code CLI](https://claude.ai/claude-code) — enables the AI agent feature (both-fists hold). Everything else works without it.

## How It Works

Gstrl uses Apple's Vision framework (`VNDetectHumanHandPoseRequest`) to detect hand landmarks from your webcam feed. A gesture classifier maps hand poses to actions — pinch detection via palm center tracking, velocity-based swipe recognition (requires open hand pose), and two-hand combo tracking. Scroll uses velocity-based joystick control. Speech mode uses Apple's `SFSpeechRecognizer` for on-device dictation and voice commands. The AI agent pipes questions to Claude Code CLI and reads responses aloud via macOS system voice. 30fps default, configurable up to 120fps. All gesture/speech processing runs locally with zero network dependency (agent mode requires internet for Claude).
